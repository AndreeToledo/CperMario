# CperMario

This was my first mayor school proyect. 

My objective was to create a playable version of Super Mario Bros. on the terminal with the knowledge I had at the time with C. It is written on plain C, and it has been one of my favourite projects. 

The 'sprites' where created using a custom font. You will need to install it on your computer, and choose it on your terminal settings, in order for everything to display properly.

Note: I recommend using a bigger font size.
